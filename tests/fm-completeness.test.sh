# Tests for bin/fm-completeness-check.sh (the formal completeness gate).
#
# Two tiers:
#   - Tooling-agnostic (always run): the off-switch, fail-open behavior, strict
#     enforcement, argument parsing. These must hold even where z3 is not
#     installed (e.g. CI), because the gate is designed to FAIL OPEN and never
#     wedge the lifecycle.
#   - Solver-dependent (run only when z3 imports): the actual SAT/UNSAT verdicts
#     for the invariant matrix.
