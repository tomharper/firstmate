# Behavior tests for bin/fm-verify-delivered.sh.
#
# This verifier has twice reported a clean result while checking nothing, so its
# whole value is that "no violations", "inspected no files", and "the search
# failed" stay three distinguishable outcomes. Every test below asserts the exit
# status as well as the wording, because the status is the contract callers act
# on, and the two regression tests named below are the reason this file exists:
#
#   test_zero_file_pathspec_reports_inspected_nothing
#     Bug 1 (2026-07-28): the pathspec matched no files, git grep reported that
#     as an ordinary no-match, and zero files inspected printed as zero
#     violations found.
#   test_no_match_is_a_result_not_a_fatal
#     Bug 2 (2026-07-29): git grep's no-match status aborted the run under
#     `set -o pipefail`, so the script printed its header and exited 1 on any
#     input. That status is now only reachable from a real violation.
