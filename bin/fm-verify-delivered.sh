# fm-verify-delivered.sh - MECHANISM, not a promise.
#
# Firstmate repeatedly reported work as delivered without checking the merged
# result against what was asked (2026-07-28/29: Stage 6 "every comparison
# through NS" when 16 files still used strings; PR 657 merged with 11 files
# still string-only after "solve every brand-related bug").
#
# Run this BEFORE telling the captain a PR delivered a capability, and BEFORE
# marking a task done. It checks the CLAIM against the CODE, not the report.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-verify-delivered.sh brand-identity [--no-fetch]
#      which files reference a brand-identity helper with no graph identifier
#   fm-verify-delivered.sh <task-id>  acceptance claims in a brief, to check by hand
#   fm-verify-delivered.sh --help     print this header
#
# The exit status is the verdict, and only 0 may be read as delivered:
#   0  CLEAN              inspected one or more files, every one of them
#                         referencing a graph identifier
#                         (in task-id mode: acceptance claims were extracted,
#                         which is a checklist to work through, not a verdict)
#   1  VIOLATIONS         inspected files with no graph identifier anywhere in
#                         them, listed above the verdict line
#   2  USAGE              bad invocation
#   3  INSPECTED NOTHING  the search matched no files, so it proves nothing
#   4  SEARCH FAILED      the search itself errored, so the answer is unknown
#
# Outcomes 3 and 4 exist because this verifier twice printed a clean result
# while checking nothing. First its pathspec matched no files, and git grep
# reports that as an ordinary no-match, so zero files inspected read as zero
# violations found. Then a git grep no-match status aborted the whole run under
# `set -o pipefail`, so it printed its header and stopped. A verifier that
# cannot say "I do not know" converts unknown into clean, which is worse than
# having no verifier at all. Every git search below therefore classifies its own
# exit status, and every count of what was actually inspected is checked before
# any clean verdict is allowed to print.
#
# A rev nobody could refresh is unknown for the same reason. brand-identity
# fetches origin before it reads $REV, and a fetch that was asked for and failed
# is outcome 4, not a warning: the verdict would otherwise be computed against
# whatever origin/main happens to be locally. --no-fetch is the honest opt-in for
# inspecting a local ref on purpose, and it never errors.
#
# tests/fm-verify-delivered.test.sh holds one regression test per outcome.
#
# Environment:
#   FM_VERIFY_REPO  repo brand-identity inspects. Resolution order: this
#                   variable, then the path data/projects.md records for
#                   inception as `repo at <path>` on its `- inception ...` line
#                   (this script parses that form directly; the registry's mode
#                   field is fm-project-mode.sh's business), then
#                   $FM_HOME/projects/inception. A miss is outcome 4, never clean.
#   FM_VERIFY_REV   rev brand-identity inspects (default: origin/main)
