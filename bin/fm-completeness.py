"""Formal completeness gate for firstmate task-lifecycle decisions.

Firstmate's "is this task done / safe to tear down / clear to merge?" calls are
really invariants (AGENTS.md prime directives #2 and #3). This turns them into a
formal rule set checked by Z3: firstmate proposes a completion claim with the
observed facts, and the solver PROVES it either SAT (consistent with every
invariant) or UNSAT (provably premature, with the violated rule named). Hard
rules gate; soft rules score (never block).

The only dependency is `z3-solver` (public PyPI) — there is no other library to
install. The rules are DATA, not code: they load from fm-completeness.rules.json
(or $FM_COMPLETENESS_RULES). This module is a small self-contained shim that
compiles that data into a Z3 model and runs the check.

Encoding: each axis is a Z3 EnumSort variable. A hard rule compiles to
`Implies(when, require AND not-forbid)`. A concrete claim is verified by asking,
per rule, whether (facts AND rule) is satisfiable — UNSAT means that rule is
violated by the facts. `prove_consistency` checks the whole hard rule set is
satisfiable over free axes (a contradiction there is a bug in the directives,
not the task). Soft rules score deterministically over the concrete metadata.

I/O: reads one JSON object of facts on stdin, e.g.
    {"name": "fix-x", "kind": "ship", "landed": "none",
     "worktree": "holds_unlanded_work", "mode": "strict",
     "metadata": {"backlog_recorded": true}}
`mode` is "strict" (default, hard invariants only) or "graded" (also scores soft
rules). All other top-level keys except name/mode/metadata are axis values.

Prints a JSON result on stdout. Exit 0 if SAT, 2 if UNSAT, 3 on a usage/tooling
error (so the bash wrapper can fail-open and defer to its own checks).
